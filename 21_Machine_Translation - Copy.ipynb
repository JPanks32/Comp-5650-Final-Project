It is split into two parts: An encoder which maps the source-text to a \"thought vector\" that summarizes the text's contents, which is then input to the second part of the neural network that decodes the \"thought vector\" to the destination-text.\n","\n","The neural network cannot work directly on text so first we need to convert each word to an integer-token using a tokenizer. But the neural network cannot work on integers either, so we use a so-called Embedding Layer to convert each integer-token to a vector of floating-point values. The embedding is trained alongside the rest of the neural network to map words with similar semantic meaning to similar vectors of floating-point values.\n","\n","For example, consider the Danish text \"der var engang\" which is the beginning of any fairytale and literally means \"there was once\" but is commonly translated into English as \"once upon a time\". We first convert the entire data-set to integer-tokens so the text \"der var engang\" becomes [12, 54, 1097]. Each of these integer-tokens is then mapped to an embedding-vector with e.g. 128 elements, so the integer-token 12 could for example become [0.12, -0.56, ..., 1.19] and the integer-token 54 could for example become [0.39, 0.09, ..., -0.12]. These embedding-vectors can then be input to the Recurrent Neural Network, which has 3 GRU-layers. See Tutorial #20 for a more detailed explanation.\n","\n","The last GRU-layer outputs a single vector - the \"thought vector\" that summarizes the contents of the source-text - which is then used as the initial state of the GRU-units in the decoder-part.\n","\n","The destination-text \"once upon a time\" is padded with special markers \"ssss\" and \"eeee\" to indicate its beginning and end, so the sequence of integer-tokens becomes [2, 337, 640, 9, 79, 3]. During training, the decoder will be given this entire sequence as input and  the desired output sequence is [337, 640, 9, 79, 3] which is the same sequence but time-shifted one step. We are trying to teach the decoder to map the \"thought vector\" and the start-token \"ssss\" (integer 2) to the next word \"once\" (integer 337), and then map the word \"once\" to the word \"upon\" (integer 640), and so forth.\n","\n","This flow-chart depicts the main idea but does not show all the necessary details e.g. regarding the loss function which is also somewhat complicated."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"bhL0JmIVFIvg"},"source":["![Flowchart](images/21_machine_translation_flowchart.png)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"mOV-2TgfFIvh"},"source":["##
